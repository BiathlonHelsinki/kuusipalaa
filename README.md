# Experiment 2
Transitional site for planning Experiment #2, the post-Temporary project in Helsinki.

Experiment #2 will hopefully be a community-supported, trans-disciplinary space running under a decentralised structure (financial, operating, programming, etc.)

This is a partial migration of the [Temporary](https://temporary.fi) codebase ([https://github.com/BiathlonHelsinki/temporary](https://github.com/BiathlonHelsinki/temporary))
 to allow user accounts to move over and the database to remain.

 This won't be much use for anyone else.

# Kuusi Palaa
Website for Kuusi Palaa, Helsinki, Finland.

## History
Once there was this place called Temporary ([https://github.com/BiathlonHelsinki/temporary](https://github.com/BiathlonHelsinki/temporary)). It ran for one year. Then it closed and a new venture was planned. During the time it was being planned, it was called Experiment #2 ([https://github.com/BiathlonHelsinki/experiment2](https://github.com/BiathlonHelsinki/experiment2)) and then it was decided to be called Kuusi Palaa.

This Ruby on Rails site begins from a copy of the Experiment #2 site.

The next experiment will be collectively designed by a larger working group and will hopefully launch in January 2018.'

  temporary_survey_explanation_past: 'Temporary ran from September 2016 to September 2017. There are plans to continue the core ideas of an open 24/7 workspace, decentralised programming and a participation-based model beginning in 2018. This next experiment will be collectively designed by a larger working group and will be designed with longevity in mind.'

  why_this_survey: 'To assist in this design, Temporary has designed this short questionnaire. We are very curious to hear your feedback: how you felt about Temporary (whether you participated zero, once or 200 times), what you are seeking from culture, and other factors.

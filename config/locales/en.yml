# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  temporary_survey_explanation_past: 'Temporary ran from September 2016 to September 2017. There are plans to continue the core ideas of an open 24/7 workspace, decentralised programming and a participation-based model beginning in 2018. This next experiment will be collectively designed by a larger working group and will be designed with longevity in mind.'

  why_this_survey: 'To assist in this design, Temporary has designed this short questionnaire. We are very curious to hear your feedback: how you felt about Temporary (whether you participated zero, once or 200 times), what you are seeking from culture, and other factors.

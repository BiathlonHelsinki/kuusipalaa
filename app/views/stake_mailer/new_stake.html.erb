<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
  This email confirms the purchase of <%= @stake.amount.to_s %> stake<%= @stake.amount > 1 ? 's' : ''%> for
  <%= @stake.owner.display_name %>
  at Kuusi Palaa.
</p>

<p>
  Please pay the attached invoice with a bank transfer by
  <%= @stake.invoice_due.strftime('%-d %b %Y') %>. Your cooperative membership and stakeholder status will be activated upon receipt of payment.
</p>

<p>
  Your stake<%= @stake.amount > 1 ? 's' : ''%> will be applied to funding season #<%= @stake.season.number.to_s %> of Kuusi Palaa, which will run from
  <%= @stake.season.start_at.strftime('%-d %b') %> until <%= @stake.season.end_at.strftime('%-d %b') %>. If not enough stakes are sold to fund season #<%= @stake.season.number.to_s %>
  and Kuusi Palaa ends, your money will be refunded (minus any small administrative costs, which will be spread evenly across all members).
</p>

<p>
  Please note: if this is your first stake, the price includes 1 share in the Kuusi Palaa cooperative/osuuskunta (10€) and your 40€ membership fee for this year.
</p>

<p>
  Payment of this invoice indicates your acceptance of the terms of the membership agreement. If you would like to review these terms,
  you can view them <a href="https://kuusipalaa.fi/pages/membership-agreement<%= @stake.owner_type == "Group" ? '-organisations' : '' %>">here</a>. The link also appears on the footer of every page on the Kuusi Palaa website if you are logged in.
</p>

<p>
  You will receive 500 points per stake to use in producing the activities at Kuusi Palaa.
  As the first season of Kuusi Palaa is not yet funded, points aren't awarded yet, but will be closer to the launch date.
